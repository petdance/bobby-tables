h1. Perl

Perl's "DBI":http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI, available on the "CPAN":http://search.cpan.org, supports parameterized SQL calls.  Both the @do@ method and @prepare@ method support parameters ("placeholders", as they call them) for most database drivers. For example:

<code>
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
foreach my $email (@emails) {
    $sth->execute($email);
    $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
    [...]
}
</code>

However, you can't use parameterization for identifiers (table names, column names) so you need to use DBI's <tt>quote_identifier()</tt> method for that:

<code>
# Make sure a table name we want to use is safe:
my $quoted_table_name = $dbh->quote_identifier($table_name);

# Assume @cols contains a list of column names you need to fetch:
my $cols = join ',', map { $dbh->quote_identifier($_) } @cols;

my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT $cols FROM $quoted_table_name ...");
</code>

You could also avoid writing SQL by hand by using <a
href="http://p3rl.org/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>, <a
href="http://p3rl.org/SQL::Abstract">SQL::Abstract</a> etc to generate your SQL
for you programmatically.

Explain Perl's taint mode and how DBI supports taint mode, both inbound and outbound.
