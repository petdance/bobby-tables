<b>Mom</b>: "Oh, dear -- Did he break something?"<br />
<b>School</b>: "In a way.  Did you really name your son Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;-- ?"<br />
<b>Mom</b>: "Oh.  Yes.  Little Bobby Tables we call him."<br />
<b>School</b>: "Well, we've lost this year's student records.  I hope you're happy."<br />
<b>Mom</b>: "And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs."<br />

h1. How to avoid Bobby Tables

There is only one way to avoid Bobby Tables attacks

* Do not create SQL statements that include outside data.
* Use parameterized SQL calls.

That's it. Don't try to escape invalid characters. Don't try to do it yourself. Learn how to use parameterized statements. Always, every single time.

The strip gets one thing crucially wrong.  The answer is not to "sanitize your database inputs" yourself.  It is prone to error.
