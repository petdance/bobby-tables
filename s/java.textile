The "JDBC API":http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html has a class called "@PreparedStatement@":http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html, which allows the programmer to safely insert user-supplied data into a SQL query.  The location of each input value in the query string is marked with a question mark.  The various @set*()@ methods are then used to safely perform the insertion.

<pre>
String name = //user input
int age = //user input
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...);
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM people WHERE lastName = ? AND age > ?");
statement.setString(1, name); //lastName is a VARCHAR
statement.setInt(2, age); //age is an INT
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
while (rs.next()){
  //...
}
</pre>

Once a @PreparedStatement@ object has been created, it can be reused multiple times for multiple queries (for example, when using the same query to update multiple rows in a table).  However, they are *not thread-safe* because of the many method calls involved in setting the parameters and executing the query.  Therefore, you should only define @PreparedStatement@ objects as method-level variables (as opposed to class-level variables) to avoid concurrency issues.

<pre>
List<Person> people = //user input
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...);
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
try{
  PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE people SET lastName = ?, age = ? WHERE id = ?");
  for (Person person : people){
    statement.setString(1, person.getLastName());
    statement.setInt(2, person.getAge());
    statement.setInt(3, person.getId());
    statement.execute();
  }
  connection.commit();
} catch (SQLException e){
  connection.rollback();
}
</pre>

More information on @PreparedStatement@ can be found in the "Oracle JDBC tutorial":http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/prepared.html.

h2. Hibernate

"Hibernate":http://www.hibernate.org/ also supports prepared statements.  See the "Hibernate Manual":http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html/objectstate.html#objectstate-querying-executing-parameters for more information.
